<h3> Abstract </h3> <br>
During the pandemic, we have many difficulties with Covid-19. One of them is classification the chest x-ray images of suspect patients. When the doctors are tired or lost their focus, they have high probability to make wrong decision and give the wrong information to patient.
So, i decided to code a artificial intelligence model to predict patients situation by looking to their chest x-ray images.

<h3> Categories </h3> <br>
In this project, we have 3 categories; Normal patient, Patient with Viral Pneumonia, and finally: Covid patient. <br>
